# FPWT2020
This is the final project subject submission for the WebTech Final 
I am basically building a website for emergency personnel to report
on the events that they attended to. Titled Uganda emergency services management system

Due to limited time the functionality might seem limited.
 
hosted site: mmmwtfp2020.uksouth.cloudapp.azure.com

how to run
load and run the sql file for all the tables and databases
clone the repository or paste to your local machine 
using this link: https://github.com/tr3p0l3m/FPWT2020.git

PHPUNIT TESTING MIGHT NOT WORK: still working on it!


Have fun!
